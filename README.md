## Usage

In retrospect, the very basic fundamental skills taught within this course will allow any individual patient & dedicated enough to create a simple webpage. No matter the usage, topic, or subject, any webpage can be made for any occasion or need. HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Git work in harmony with eachother in a comprehensive, well developed setup. Each branch handles & creates each piece of the webpage similar to a building block. Each building block is critical for the webpage to be displayed & ran properly. Without one element, the webpage will not run properly or not be displayed properly. In the end, it runs like a well-oiled machine. Added to the convenience of developers is the DevTools console, a very substantial piece in which allows us to easily debug and execute a webpage in development to experiment and view it in real-time.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
